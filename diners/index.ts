An exception to the above rule is when a Settlement Currency holiday prevents settlement on a certain date. This
is where there is a holiday which affects the transfer of funds in a particular Settlement Currency and the banks
cannot settle in that currency on that date. These currency holidays will be handled automatically by the
Interchange settlement process in conjunction with the Settlement Agency and Recaps affected by the currency
holiday will be settled on the next Business Day.
